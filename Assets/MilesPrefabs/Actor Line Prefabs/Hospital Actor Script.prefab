  - 'From language barriers to cultural differences in healthcare practices, every
    visit to the hospital was a learning experience that reinforced the resilience
    and strength of our immigrant community. '
  - The first few times visiting medical centers for check-ups and vaccinations were
    overwhelming yet necessary steps in our journey.
  - The unfamiliar sights and sounds of the medical environment stirred up feelings
    of vulnerability, but knowing that it was for our well-being gave us the strength
    to persevere.
  - My aunt accompanied us to various medical centers, ensuring that we received
    the necessary check-ups and healthcare that we had never had access to back in
    Laos. Her guidance and advocacy were invaluable as we navigated a healthcare
    system that was entirely foreign to us.
  - "I remember being sick. I had the chickenpox and I was treated. We had a language
    barrier because my parents didn\u2019t speak English and we didn't either, you
    know, I was a 7-year-old. I never felt unsafe or mistreated, though, maybe because
    I didn't know any better. "
