  - 'Finding employment was a crucial step in establishing ourselves in our new home. '
  - 'My first days at work were really great. The people were very nice and very
    welcoming. We had a really good team. We used to even hang out after work sometimes. '
  - 'Immigrants often do a lot of cleaning jobs. Even my mother-in-law did. It''s
    tough for everyone. I remember when my father-in-law first came here, he did
    theater cleaning, which had to be done around 2 in the morning. My mom and I
    wanted to help, so we went with him. '
  - I made $3.75 an hour through a summer youth program. They take in youth workers
    during the summer and we do various odd things like, you know, picking the trash,
    dumping it out, and going to the office and cleaning, you know, things like that.
    As Asians, we were very family-oriented. So I didn't get to keep the money. It
    helped go towards other things,like with grocery bills and whatnot.
