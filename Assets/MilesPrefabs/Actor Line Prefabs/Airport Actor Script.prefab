  - "My family wasn\u2019t with me, my friends, my world. I found myself jumping
    from one place to the other fast without evaluating the life I was leaving behind.
    I was upset with myself even though I was very young. It made me appreciate my
    home country\u2019s worth and my parents. You may think something is fine and
    dandy in your mind but the reality may be something strange and scary."
  - I was so worried, in general, because I had literally nothing. Later, I found
    myself really scared because I didn't know English. I couldn't drive.
  - "I moved here when I was 7 years old. I was pushed back a year because of the
    English barrier. It was really hard to understand the American culture. I didn't
    know a lot of the things American kids talked about. I felt very isolated, so
    that caused me to pick up a lot of different things and push my cultures aside
    and try to pick up the American culture as fast as I could: the language, the
    shows, the outfits. So, in 7th grade, I had this one instant where I was trying
    to explain something to my mom, and I remember, like, her not fully understanding
    what I was saying and that was because of me pushing my culture to the side,
    my language to the side, my Bengali culture and heritage to the side, that I
    wasn't able to fully communicate and express what I wanted to express to my mom,
    and that was kind of like an awakening moment. And I remember that instant as
    being like a driving force to kind of reconnect with my culture to understand
    the duality of my different identities as a Bengali American. I didn\u2019t have
    to choose one or the other."
  - "I didn\u2019t know anything to survive here. "
  - "I didn\u2019t know if I could even get a job."
  - 'I felt very alone. '
  - I missed my family a lot.
  - (together) Despite everything, this is where I wanted to be.
  - 'It was the first time for the whole family, too. We were going to an unknown
    world. When I got off, it felt so new and mysterious because I was now in the
    United States. '
  - With only a few pairs of clothing in a plastic bag and a pair of sneakers on
    my feet, I boarded the airplane. The donated sweater given to me upon arrival
    was a small comfort against the cool weather of the city. Despite our shared
    journey, my fellow refugees on the plane were all navigating this new experience
    individually, unable to provide much comfort to one another.
  - "I haven\u2019t really asked my parents what it was like for them."
