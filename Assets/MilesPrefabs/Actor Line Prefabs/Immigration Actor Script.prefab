  - The immigration office was both a symbol of hope and bureaucracy.
  - "I was very nervous. When I didn\u2019t have a green card, the waiting line was
    extremely long. I could see people were anxious about facing the officer at the
    passport checking area. Everyone was intentionally smiling big at the officer. "
  - Because of long flights, I was extremely tired, but I tried to look as good as
    possible for the officer. We were hoping for no problems. We were hoping for
    the best.
  - "The waiting made me very anxious.. I didn\u2019t want to fly back 10 hours to
    Korea, being separated from my family here."
  - I felt so happy to be able to start a new life in America.
  - (together) I have to be a citizen
