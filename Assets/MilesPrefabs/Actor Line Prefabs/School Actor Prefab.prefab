  - 'I remember all these stupid kids. I was growing up as a Chinese-American in
    New Mexico. See, back then, I just knew I was different, but now that I think
    about it. . . man, those were a bunch of minorities picking on someone who''s
    more of a minority. '
  - "At that time, there's a show called Kung Fu on, right? and it was very popular.
    And these kids would bring me sticks of crap and hold it for me and say, \u201CBreak
    it.\u201D And the odd thing about it, right, I just said, \u201CWell, okay. I'll
    try.\u201D"
  - "And so, they bring these whole things of branches, and I was smacking them,
    and I remember getting bruises and cuts on my hands because I just tried to break
    these things because\u2013the thing is\u2013well, \u201CYou're Chinese, so you
    must know Kung Fu.\u201D And I just remember thinking, \u201CMan, that hurts.\u201D"
  - "And I remember just little things, like bringing lunch.  I would bring joong
    to school and just Chinese stuff, right? And  people are like, \u201COh, what's
    that? What's that?\u201DI was getting really embarrassed because they asked me
    about it, right? And I called it a Chinese tamale because  I knew what a tamale
    was, right? And then they asked what the ingredients were in it, and I said Chinese
    sausage. And the kids go, \u201COh, what? He said Chinese shit! He's eating Chinese
    shit! !"
  - 'As a parent, I always felt sorry. Although our kids did well, they didn''t receive
    as much support from their parents, especially since we didn''t know much about
    the USA, and we felt inadequate. '
  - "I think people don\u2019t always like what\u2019s different. Maybe they don\u2019t
    like what they don\u2019t understand.  "
